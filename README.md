As a prerequisite, ensure that you have docker installed locally on your machine. [Install Docker Engine](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/)

The code for my website is hosted on [GitHub](https://github.com/paschalogu/personal-website).  To follow along, fork and clone this repository and change directory into it by running the commands below:</p>
